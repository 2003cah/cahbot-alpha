#### ***A small Discord bot with loads of potential, but here we test it.***

Heyo, this is CahBot Alpha! Where stuff is so experimental, the word "experimental" loses its meaning

## Commands

Y'know, it's hard to update this list every single time I update something, so just use `A^cmds` and figure it out, thanks!

#### **Why is this repo here, you may ask**
 
 Well, it's a pretty easy way to transfer code from my PC to my VPS, that's about all. Some sort of license for using code will appear soon:tm:
