#### ***A small Discord bot with loads of potential, but here we test it.***

Heyo, this is CahBot Beta! Where we test the bot just to make sure the bot doesn't break, that's no good!

## Commands

Anyways, here's the current command list (literally just copy & pasted from the command list, but spiced up a bit.)

Command |  Description
--------------------|--------------
(upon saying "CB prefix") | Reminds you the prefix.
`B^info` | Shows you some info about CB, or something idk.
`B^rnumber` [Low Num] [High Num] | Gives you a random number between a given range. Ex: `B^rnumber 1 10`
`B^help` | Shows a message telling you to use `B^cmds`
`B^cmds` | Returns a list of commands
`B^eightball` | Shake the magic 8ball!
`B^userinfo` | Show some basic info about yourself.
`B^reverse` | Reverses text.
`B^flip` | flips a coin, with actual responses
`B^flop` | flips a coin, but with memes instead
`B^ping` | Used to show response time
`B^servercount` | Shows how many servers CahBot is on!
`B^invite` | Gives you a link to invite the bot to your own server!
`B^die` | Shuts me down, only Cah can use this command!
`B^roll` | Rolls a number between 1 and 6
`B^eval` | Like you don't know what eval commands do (you still can't run them anyway)
`B^donate` | Want to donate? That's great! This command gives you a link for Donorbox donations
`B^update` | Gives you the latest CB update
`B^say` | Makes CB say something, you need the manage messages permission tho

`B^thanks` | Thanks to these radical donors!
`B^noot` | NOOT (aka best command)
 
#### **Why is this repo here, you may ask**
 
 Well, it's a pretty easy way to transfer code from my PC to my VPS, that's the only reason. But if you want, you can use some of the code
